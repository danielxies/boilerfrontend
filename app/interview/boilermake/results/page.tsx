    score: 7
  },
  {
    interviewer: "Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly?",
    interviewee: "When our team needed to implement real-time features, I had to learn WebSocket and Socket.io within a week. I studied the documentation, built small prototypes, and successfully integrated it into our production app, enabling live updates for thousands of users.",
    interviewer_feedback: "Excellent example with clear impact",
    score: 9

  {
    interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to optimize application performance.",
    interviewee: "I identified and fixed several performance bottlenecks in our React application. This included implementing memo and useCallback hooks, lazy loading components, and optimizing Redux state management. These changes improved our app's load time by 40%.",
    interviewer_feedback: "Great technical detail and measurable results",
    score: 9
  },
  {
    interviewer: "How do you stay updated with new technologies?",
    interviewee: "I follow tech blogs, participate in online communities, and build side projects to experiment with new tools. Recently, I've been exploring Rust and WebAssembly to understand their potential benefits for our web applications.",
    interviewer_feedback: "Shows proactive learning and curiosity",

  {
    interviewer: "What's your experience with database design?",
    interviewee: "I designed and optimized databases for several projects. In one case, I improved query performance by 60% by adding appropriate indexes and normalizing the schema. I'm comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL databases, having used PostgreSQL and MongoDB extensively.",
    interviewer_feedback: "Strong technical knowledge with practical examples",
